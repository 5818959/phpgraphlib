Used with dynamic data, PHPGraphLib allows easy visual interpretation of sophisticated data sets. Simply feed PHPGraphLib an array of data points, and it will generate a .png chart of your data.\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\nThe first version PHPGraphLib was written in 2007 by Elliott Brueggeman to\r\ndeliver PHP generated graphs quickly and easily. It has grown in both features\r\nand maturity since its inception, but remains PHP 4+ compatible. Originally\r\navailable only for paid commercial use, PHPGraphLib was open-sourced in 2013 \r\nunder the MIT License.
